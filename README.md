The Allegro MicroSystems ACS37800 power monitoring IC greatly simplifies the addition of power monitoring to many powered systems.

Allegroâ€™s Hall-effect-based, galvanically isolated current sensing technology achieves reinforced isolation ratings in a small PCB footprint.
These features enable isolated current sensing without expensive Rogowski coils, oversized current transformers, isolated operational amplifiers,
or the power loss of shunt resistors.

The ACS37800 power monitoring IC offers key power measurement parameters that can easily be accessed through its digital interface. Dedicated and
configurable I/O pins for voltage/current zero crossing, undervoltage and overvoltage reporting, and fast overcurrent fault detection are available.
User configuration of the IC is available through on-chip EEPROM.

Although the ACS37800 is available with both I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI interfaces, this library currently only supports communication over I2C.
